# FAQ

{% hint style="info" %}
I'm just using the GitBook to type up these questions because I'm locked out of google docs right now. But it would be good to create a FAQ section in the docs, and I can polish up the questions and answers before this docs goes live.

### **Ongoing Progress**

What are the current projects being worked on?

There was talk of making investment "tomorrow" back in December. What's blocking us from being able to make these investments?

* Who is working on unblocking this? What is the current progress?
* If it's legal stuff, what are the challenges specifically?
* Once this is unblocked, can we start building at lightning speed, or will there be blockers?

What is the DAOSphere? I've read the discord transcripts and google docs, but I still don't really understand. Has work on this started yet?

I understand the DAO race was scrapped because of groupthink affecting the decision making process. What is the new process of selecting DAOs? Will the DAO race come back?

What are the current dev projects being worked on right now? New landing page is complete, DAO race + sphere aren't active. What's next for dev? I want to write code and build things, but there doesn't seem to be much to do rn.

What are the legal, marketing, PM, and investing teams working on? These roles exist in #role request, but there doesn't seem to be any pods around these? Do these teams exist right now, or are they not needed until later on?

### Core team

Who is in the core team?

What's the difference between core and the rest of the community? Is the core team working on Hyperscale full time? Are they being paid?

How community owned is Hyperscale? E.g. there are many private startups that have open source projects (Vercel, MUI etc), but external contributors have zero ownership / equity. Is this the case with Hyperscale?

How did the core team form? Did they all know each other before Hyperscale? Or did it form from a decentralised community?

Is there a path for community members to join the core team? If so, how?

There's `mod` and `moderator` as distinct roles on discord. What's the difference? (I think `mod` is core team, `moderator` is community moderators)

### Tokenomics

I still don't really understand the tokenomics. I know there will be NFTs, governance tokens, and stablecoins - but don't know the bigger picture.

What's the purpose of the NFT in this context? Is stablecoin comp for contributors, alpha from the investments, or both?

Which token is the crypto DAO analogy to "equity" in a traditional startup? How can community/contributors earn these?

I know the fund will start with only private investors for legal reasons. Does this no alpha from the fund will be distributed to token holders / "equity" holders - until it's open for public investment?

How does the tokenomics structure change when the public is able to invest?

Is the plan to have one big airdrop like ENS, or slowly drop new tokens to community + contributors?

### Other

A lot of us initally heard about Hyperscale from Sam. How involved is he in the project? I know he's hands-off, but are the core team regularly in touch with him?

The inital plan was $10M of Sam's money, it's now $1M. Why the change, and will he be investing more in the future?

There are other private investors also investing, what percent is Sam vs other investors (approximately)?

Are there any differences between Hyperscale and The DAO? Main one I can think of is community investment vs Sam/private investment.
