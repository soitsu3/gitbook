    Infrastructure that enables a global standard for commerce

    We give grants, build, & partner with projects that establish the global standard for commerce. This standard allows people to securely conduct business, invest, enforce contracts, and much more!

    The process of establishing the global standard for commerce is iterative. The market and its participants will favor some over others. The foundation must continuously experiment and support the best standards.
