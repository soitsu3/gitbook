# Vision

### Global Landscape

The internet has enabled global commerce at the speed of light. An internet connection and cryptocurrency wallet let anyone plug into the internet economy. Access to capital is limited by geographic location and network. We believe that the global internet economy should have universal access to capital.

### New world order

Hyperscale believes in a global economy that allows people to securely conduct business & democratize access to opportunities. Anyone from around the world, without knowing each other, can plug into this economy and be rewarded. We have observed a need for a service that provides economic access to everyone with an internet connection.

This economy isn't reliant on the physical world yet governments hold geographic monopolies over violence in which they enforce outdated rules and regulations. The world will work under one standard rather than being isolated by separate jurisdictions. There will be a global standard for commerce, rather than it being controlled by monopolies, it will become an economy of scale powerful enough to rival what legacy governments have created. The more market players the better the market is for everyone—the internet opens the market to everyone.

If we build a global fund for the internet economy, rather than a regional fund, we believe that we could uncover the greatest project of the century.

More capital will follow on to the internet economy. There will be a standard for global investing—internet native organizational structure, investment process, legal system, & standard contracts—that the internet economy will converge and operate on. The process of establishing the global standard for commerce is iterative. The market and its participants will favor some over others. These standards will no longer be enforced by a monopoly.
